Examples of possible projects
\begin{itemize}
\item Catapults, cannons, throwing of objects. Can include analytical and experimental data.
\item Skydiver and plot the $g$-forces, can illustrate why a parachute needs to open slowly!
\item Bungee-jumping! Great for teaching spring forces and programming technicalities.
\item Block and spring, harmonic Oscillator
\item Orbits of planets in the solar system with real data from NASA
\item Pendulum (also with large angles!)
\end{itemize}
